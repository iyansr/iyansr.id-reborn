### My 2024: A Year of Resilience and Growth

As the year comes to an end, I’ve been thinking about everything that happened in 2024. It’s been a year full of ups and downs, challenges, and valuable lessons.

#### A Sudden Change: Facing Uncertainty

This year started with a tough experience. In March, I got laid off for the first time in my life. It was shocking and scary. Suddenly, everything felt uncertain, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it might happen again. It was a difficult time, and it really shook my confidence.

#### Taking on the Challenge

After that, life didn’t slow down. I had to take on two or even three jobs at once just to keep going. It was exhausting and often overwhelming. But through it all, I discovered a strength in myself that I didn’t know I had. Every late night and hard decision helped me realize that I could handle tough situations.

#### New Opportunities

Despite the challenges, 2024 also brought some amazing opportunities. I got to work with incredible people from all over the world. Working with a US company and a Singaporean company was a dream come true. It gave me the chance to learn about different cultures and ways of working.

This year, I also learned a lot about Web3. I worked on exciting projects and learned from some of the best in the industry. The fast pace and innovation in this field kept me motivated and eager to learn more.

#### What I Learned

Looking back, 2024 taught me a lot:

1. **Resilience is Key**: Facing tough times made me stronger and showed me how to adapt.
2. **Unexpected Changes Can Lead to Growth**: Losing my job felt like the end of the world, but it actually led to new opportunities.
3. **People Matter**: The support and teamwork of those I worked with made a huge difference in my journey.

#### Looking Ahead

I’m still a little afraid of getting laid off again, but that fear doesn’t control me anymore. Instead, it motivates me to keep learning and preparing for the future. As I step into 2025, I’m taking with me the lessons, strength, and hope I gained this year.

2024 was a tough year, but it was also full of growth and achievements. It taught me that challenges can lead to new opportunities and that the journey is just as important as the destination. Here’s to facing whatever comes next with courage and hope.
